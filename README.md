## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- OOP
- Vite

### What I learned

I had to overwrite the whole style of the project again, because I realized that it was not responsive at all and it's time to adopt a **mobile-first workflow**.

It was a good practice to learn how to hide input fields and make labels play the main role in the design.

### Continued development

Thereâ€™s still a lot to learn and practice when it comes to Object-Oriented Programming.
